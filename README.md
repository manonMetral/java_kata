# java_kata
Repository to stock some kata in java with basic configuration

## Dependencies

Basic configuration in java 21 with :
* junit jupiter
* assertj
* maven-surefire-plugin

## Constraints to execute this kata

Principle of a kata is to be repeated to increase our skills in development, but just repeat the same exercise without objective can be lazy, so I propose you to have little objectives each time you repeat this kata. These objectives are so generic, so they can be operated for many kata.

This kata has been created to improve our competence to do TDD, so that's the first constraint is that you have to use TDD each time you do it.

Second constraint will be to optimize code by doing :
* a maximum variable
* having the least repeated code at the end.
* optimized iterations (as if-else)

Third constraint should be to minimize the time to code :
* less than an hour first
* less than 30 min second
* less than 15 min third
* ... and so on if you can

Fourth constraints should be to do it in another language after well understanding.

## Advance

Doing a kata is more interesting when you do it by pair programming. 

Pair programming allows to :
* Highlight misunderstanding in order
* Take a step back to the problem and find easily solutions
* Highlight different methods to solve the kata

If you can do your kata with someone else at least once that should be great !
